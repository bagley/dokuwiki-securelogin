Securelogin Dokuwiki Plugin
==============

This plugin uses [Tom Wu's implementation of RSA algorithm in JavaScript](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/) on the client to encrypt the login password with the server's public key. The encrypted password is then sent to the server where it can be decrypted. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented by using a variable token (salt) added to the password before encrypting. Therefore, replay attacks don't work.

When securelogin is used, there is always a *use securelogin* checkbox near the password field. If the browser has no JavaScript or JavaScript is disabled, then obviously, the passwords are sent in clear text, as they are by default with DokuWiki. In this case though, the user *should* notice the absence of the checkbox.

Also, whenever a password has to be entered, it is automagically encrypted by this plugin, be it on the login, profile or the admin page.

Download and Installation
--------------

  - Download and install the plugin using the [Plugin Manager](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:plugin). You can search for "securelogin" to find the plugin in the Plugin Manager. Refer to [Plugins](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) on how to install plugins manually.
  - Go the admin pages and select *securelogin*. Then click on the 'generate-new-key' button.
  - You're done. From then on, all passwords are encrypted before being sent.

For support for these older versions use this: [https://github.com/bagley/dokuwiki-securelogin/archive/c1f0a0e018cedfd29a48ab157098efe480e37049.zip](https://github.com/bagley/dokuwiki-securelogin/archive/c1f0a0e018cedfd29a48ab157098efe480e37049.zip)

How it works
--------------

Normally when you submit your 'MySecretPa$$word', you will see it in the data transfer:

```
sectok:
id:start
do:login
u:MyUser
p:MySecretPa$$word
```

You can easily see the 'MySecretPa$$word' in the above example.

But when you use this plugin, it will encrypt the password, which can only be decrypted on the server.

```
sectok:
id:start
do:login
u:MyUser
p:******
use_securelogin:1
securelogin:M66YMHFzjl9qXa96zr2JzDWlV3WTE+4mOgJZNNr3yW9xPzSORtSIjp+ZNczopNUp5N0M0ASiqutgf1nio+iTNj3pS24kHD1LZb6GcG7cFvpr/uzfxJsO8jAbFD6/ZkB0xy9vBMabn3BYP7GWLrTR3b/7zNdla/FdqjX9U48dHMrcO2/ZFJKLsdzt84/bC+3xoV7/qC/BZO5AbQ37SvLEC7DaMTMtbSqlF573Y0iOMb3wYe1rj2m/HQiBM8ro25OBfnUxmgJFMVVkfkLdNUepRjUeeJSXF+R5XDcO2L4uX9D8AOE8nSecRn+0gqwz6PzPPqEpv60y0Io1rZXevG+I9Q==
```

The javascript on the page takes the form's password variable `p=MySecretPa$$word`, encrypts it with the provided salt (that changes on each page load), and sets the result as `securelogin`. It also replaces `p`'s value with stars so it can't submit the password in the clear.

When the server receives the data, it sees that `use_securelogin` is set to `1` (true), so it knows the password was encrypted. It will decrypt the `securelogin` variable and separate it from the salt value. From this it gets the `p=MySecretPa$$word` value, which it sets so the Dokuwiki authentication routines have it. Dokuwiki can then compare the passwords like it normally does.

This same process happens during the add user, modify user, and edit profile options. This is what will be seen if someone views a user changing their password:

```
do:profile
fullname:MyUser
email:user@example.com
newpass:******
passchk:******
oldpass:******
use_securelogin:1
securelogin:mCUIwYbHRgNjmAkr1CHssH8g1ZAgGKIxsFsMZUN1XM703V2g4hB5upzfJeVyE/aT9ByOYxQChbhRyJezjD7jO4LKwlgBR/Jnqkr+rUr70MLcoRybM8maTGdAGDM3VweSylqAGOASKb87hKYb0URUFo+yfGaKp572IWCfSZDHLrP1Hrs/f7EYKXozXpMNHA3l/VXNm2wGAwvkvnfFgkRZonrdfdUlLDC0OkBpa3WawMqoYb+1/kcuGsBcAve0Tp+uMQZw8FwHj8SOp9kJLUnEqXrop2pXa3mc9j8NS54CeCbJuJ0qfEhUHIE9/BHUgbmCPQV6XNWttZbRp8r1Q1dG/g==
```

In this case, all three passwords are encrypted into `securelogin`, and the post values replaced with stars.
