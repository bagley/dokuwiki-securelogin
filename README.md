Securelogin Dokuwiki Plugin
==============

This plugin uses [Tom Wu's implementation of RSA algorithm in JavaScript](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/) on the client to encrypt the login password with the server's public key. The encrypted password is then sent to the server where it can be decrypted. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented by using a variable token (salt) added to the password before encrypting. Therefore, replay attacks don't work.

When securelogin is used, there is always a *use securelogin* checkbox near the password field. If the browser has no JavaScript or JavaScript is disabled, then obviously, the passwords are sent in clear text, as they are by default with DokuWiki. In this case though, the user *should* notice the absence of the checkbox.

Also, whenever a password has to be entered, it is automagically encrypted by this plugin, be it on the login, profile or the admin page.

Download and Installation
--------------

  - Download and install the plugin using the [Plugin Manager](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:plugin). You can search for "securelogin" to find the plugin in the Plugin Manager. Refer to [Plugins](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) on how to install plugins manually.
  - Go the admin pages and select *securelogin*. Then click on the 'generate-new-key' button.
  - You're done. From then on, all passwords are encrypted before being sent.
