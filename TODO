# Todo and Ideas

## Optional Required Encryption

Add option to forbid logging in without the password encrypted (Warning, this could lock you out)
- would need the login boxes be hidden if javascript is not enabled.
- probably have to hook into the login function and remove the html for the boxes, then add them back in with javascript.

## Add SHA256 verification codes.

Add sha256 sums to the HTML, to have the browser check that they have not been tampered with in transit.
